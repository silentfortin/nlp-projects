Napoleon Bonaparte, born Napoleone di Buonaparte, was a French statesman and military leader who played a significant role during the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars. He became Emperor of the French as Napoleon I from 1804 to 1814 and briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days. Napoleon's leadership and military prowess allowed him to dominate European and global affairs for over a decade. He won most of his battles and built a vast empire that covered a significant part of continental Europe.

Napoleon is regarded as one of the greatest commanders in history, and his military campaigns are studied in military schools worldwide. His political and cultural legacy remains both celebrated and controversial. He was born in Corsica to an Italian family of minor nobility. Joining the French army as an artillery officer, he quickly rose through the ranks during the French Revolution and became a general at the age of 24.

Given command of the Army of Italy, Napoleon achieved remarkable success against the Austrians and Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs. He conquered the Italian Peninsula and established "sister republics" with local support. In 1798, he led a military expedition to Egypt, which propelled him to political power. Through a coup in 1799, he became the First Consul of the Republic and, in 1804, he declared himself the first Emperor of the French.

Napoleon faced several coalitions against France, with the British as his main adversaries. However, he achieved decisive victories in battles such as Ulm and Austerlitz, breaking the Third Coalition and dissolving the Holy Roman Empire. He defeated Prussia in the battles of Jena and Auerstedt and expanded his empire into Eastern Europe.

Despite facing resistance in Spain and Portugal during the Peninsular War, as well as diplomatic conflicts with Russia due to the Continental System, Napoleon maintained control over much of Europe. In 1812, his invasion of Russia led to a disastrous campaign and the collapse of the French Empire. The War of the Sixth Coalition, joined by Prussia and Austria, culminated in Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. The Allies invaded France, captured Paris, and forced Napoleon to abdicate in 1814. He was initially exiled to Elba but escaped and briefly regained power in France before being defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. He was subsequently exiled to the remote island of Saint Helena, where he died at the age of 51.

Napoleon's influence extended beyond military conquests. He introduced liberal reforms in the territories he controlled, including the Low Countries, Switzerland, and parts of Italy and Germany. His Napoleonic Code had a profound impact on legal systems in numerous countries. Napoleon's achievements encompassed meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern education, sound finances, and the abolition of feudalism. He also fostered science, arts, and efficient local administration. British historian Andrew Roberts credits Napoleon with championing and expanding these ideas, consolidating them, and extending their geographic reach, making him a significant figure in shaping the modern world.
