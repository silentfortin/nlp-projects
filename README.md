# NLP Projects

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects and experiments focused on core tasks and theoretical approaches in computational linguistics.

## Contents

- **NER Tagger**: Named Entity Recognition using supervised sequence labeling methods.
- **FrameNet**: Experiments and code related to FrameNet-based semantic similarity and concept analysis.
- **NASARI**: Semantic similarity and relatedness measures using the NASARI concept vector space.
- **WordNet**: Tools and scripts for analyzing word sense disambiguation and concept relations exploiting WordNet lexical database.
- **content2form**: Code for transforming and analyzing lexical or semantic content, possibly via paraphrasing or abstraction.
- **defs**: Utilities to extract, process, and compare word/concept definitions, supporting similarity and disambiguation studies.
- **Hanks**: Computational investigations into Hanks' theory of meaning construction and lexical analysis.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Each project folder contains its own requirements or instructions (commonly: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, spaCy, nltk).
